Status:

part1: Works on all tests.
part2: Works on all tests.
part3: Works on all tests.
part4: Works on all tests.
part5: Works on all tests that we wrote. 

Overall: So for part5, the new BNF is as follows: 

	for ::= '{' [assignment] '`' [compare] '`' [assignment] block '}' 

	compare ::= ['<'['=']] | ['>'['=']] | [ '=''=' ] | ['!' '='] 

	The reason why we picked this BNF is because has a similar structure to a C for
	loop. For compare we had to recycle the terminals so we can use them as boolean
	logic comparisons.
